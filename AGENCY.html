The content featured on this web page was copied from an obsolete version of the web page named AGENCY on the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com. That copied content captures several "inadequacies" which karbytes noticed on 25_NOVEMBER_2024.

inadequacy_0: An information processing agent could still have control over the phenomena it perceives even if that information processing agent appears to itself to have no body which is distinguishable from its environment.

inadequacy_1: In order for an information processing agent to take the form of a physical object within a physical universe, that information processing agent would presumably need to "directly" control some object, X, comprised of a finite (and unique) allocation (and permutation) of matter, energy, space, and time yet lack such ("direct") control over the movements or transformations of any objects which are not determined by that information processing agent to be part of X (and X would necessarily constitute that information processing agent's means for perceiving its environment and for interacting with its environment (i.e. "indirectly" controlling its environment)).
