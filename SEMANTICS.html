SEMANTICS: a logically congruent set of rules which assign particular meanings to repeatable symbols within a particular language used by at least one information processing agent.

SYNTAX: a logically congruent set of rules which assign particular (fixed) meanings to repeatable symbols within a particular language used by at least one information processing agent (and such that those rules pertain specifically if not exclusively to how keywords and operators within mathematical or programmatic statements are logically related to each other and to "their" operands).

SYMBOL: an irreducible unit of (hypothetically transmissible) information which takes the form of a fixed and finite (in terms of space, time, matter, and energy) pattern (and which is assigned by that symbol's respective and "encompassing" language to logically (if not physically) represent some uniquely-associated piece of information).

* * *

// The following two (logical) statements referred to by their respective symbols, A and B, depict (phenotypically and semantically) unique statements (though both A and B could both be described as variable assignment specifications). 

A: “0 = 0”.

// left-hand value is identical to right-hand value.

// left-hand value and right-hand value represent the same unique integer.

B: “0 = 1”.

// left-hand variable is set to right-hand value.

// left-hand variable (at least temporally) represents the right-hand integer.
