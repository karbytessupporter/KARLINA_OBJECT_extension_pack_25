SOLIPSISM: the attribute of a particular subjective rendering of phenomena (and the space-time and matter-energy "matrix" which comprise those phenomena (at least at a "hardware" level)) being experienced by exactly one information processing agent.

Note that solipsism is logically compatible with the possibility that more than one (apparently (to itself) "solipsistic") frame of reference (and accompanying knowledge "database") exist (either simultaneously or  "(chronologically) one at a time").
