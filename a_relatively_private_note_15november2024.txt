original_title: women_are_spiritual_cripples

This note is a bit “ad homimen” sounding and quite a bit prejudiced and condescending compared to the content I usually publish via karbytes. Hence, this note will likely be placed in the relatively hidden portion of my blog referred to as the “box_of_gems”.

Part of why I feel so depressed is how little I have seen women even come close to embodying my intellectual ideals. I would say for every 100 humans whose work I come to discover which pertains to my academic interests, less than one of them seems to be a woman while the other 99 are almost all men (and very few of them are African Americans (and I see a connection between women behaving like hyper sexual and hypo intellectual chimpanzees and chauvinist (and violent or aggressive) male posturing which seems to be especially prevalent amongst African American culture which seems to have metastasized the mainstream entertainment industries to some non-trivial extent)).

(If I seem to “hate” Blacks, it’s because they have, by far, initialized the most physical violence against me compared to any other race (even while on the job). Without going into detail, I can personally attest for why Blacks and Browns seem to be the poorest racial demographics in the United States: they are the most patriarchal, anti-intellectual, and violent (well, maybe just the Blacks in this case)).

I keep hoping that I’ll discover a woman scientist, engineer, or philosopher who is as hard-core about metaphysics as I and seemingly many other men are but only seem to find woman who are only relatively casually interested in such things and instead more people-centric rather than impersonal, biology rather than physics oriented, and passive and follower-like instead of active and authority-like (and horribly inferior when it comes to mastery of the English language (because I have heard men come up with very succinct, information-dense, witty (without fishing for compliments), original, and with effortless flow while I have not heard very many women in such roles spout much more than teacher’s pet style drivel in a tepid, feet-draggy, and excessively humility-exuding whimper of a “flow” (peppered with nervous unfunny laughter and exaggerated facial expressions)).

I understand women were historically held back from academia, governance, and even self-sovereignty compared to men for what seems like more than 95% of human history and that women were generally sexually selected and socialized into being little more than livestock to keep the human population well stocked with fresh and able bodies. I see how deeply ingrained the idea is that women only have value to humanity as vessels of new life rather than as having more intrinsic worth like what men have been by far more encouraged to see themselves as having. Hence, only men were permitted to attain literacy, own property, pursue higher education, and be religious and political leaders throughout most of human history while women were kept relegated to the birthing and child rearing chambers much like sheep in a pen. What is particularly disgusting and disturbing to me is how almost no women in modern times seem to think they have alternative options to being cucks to the patriarchy with no intrinsic value and who only seem to live as parasites whose hosts are their own sexual and reproductive functions (and their children and male partners are little more than their credentials for taking up space in the world (but only the children and their male partners seem to become more intelligent and agential over time while the increasingly obsolete short-shelf-life hags descend into childish pettiness, cattiness, idle blind consumerism, and intellectual atrophy)).

Hence, I cannot help but think most women are intellectually crippled and daresay spiritually crippled because of how little they seem to have a legitimate zest for life, metaphysical rigor, and stoic qualities. They instead come across to me as profoundly distressed, mentally checked out, zombie-like whores whose thoughts stay depressingly shallow, gossip-laden, unoriginal, lazy, unimaginative, excusing of inadequacy, and banal (i.e. limited to short-term survival oriented concerns and only flippant hand-wavy virtue signaling about contributing to the betterment of civilization or of the ecosystem supporting it). I have yet to see any women exude the kind of fervor I and other testosterone-laden intellectuals seem to have for topics which actually transcend anthropocentrisim (and that leads me to also generally conclude that ethnic groups whose worldview centers around belief in some kind of human-like, parental God are similarly childlike, intellectually lazy, and disgustingly ape-centric (which is why I’m not particularly interested in wasting my time in “warm” and “family-oriented” cultures which are not quite as tech-savvy and science-driven as my preferred cultures)).

I have proposed that, if a cisgendered woman wants to truly overcome the crippling shackles of femininity (or, more accurately, deficiency of masculinity), I strongly implore her to take testosterone sufficient to match the testosterone levels of what would be normal for a cisgendered man her age. That way, she can actually close the gap preventing women from literally being men: superior in physical strength, more aggressively and unapologetically self-serving (despite the fact that all organisms are fundamentally and exclusively self-serving), and daresay better at mentally concentrating on logic-heavy tasks (rather than tiring easily of them due to a lack of monkey faces and voices populating her attention span) and even appreciating and creating legitimately good works of art (because what women seem to come up with hardly passes for art and instead seems to be some child vying for Daddy’s approval and support as though she were doing little other than put on a “brave face” while apparently falling apart inside without some man to do the heavy lifting of her life for her).

In short, I hope to inspire a revolution of transmasculine people (i.e. humans who may have started genetically intersex or cisgendered female but then opted to self-administer testosterone in order to “bridge the gap” into becoming essentially identical to cisgendered men (apart from genotype, genitalia, and reproductive capacities)). Such people could still gestate and lactate offspring by retaining their original reproductive organs and temporally ceasing testosterone injections. The society would just be more eudamonia-laden rather than polluted with inconsolable and relatively crippled waifs who are essentially troubled by how little they amount to outside of sex and reproduction.

I almost forgot to append the following to this note because, perhaps, it pertains to aesthetics (and I am sick of calling attention to aesthetics (and women seem to be socialized to be hyper focused on their superficial appearance in the way they are by far the biggest consumers of cosmetics, fashion apparel, and beauty treatments at the salon)).

A woman’s breasts might shrink a little as a result of taking testosterone (but their capacity to generate milk won’t be diminished). If such a woman wants to have large, bulbous tits she can opt for silicone implant surgery or wear a padded bra.

A woman’s voice might deepen, but she will almost certainly retain her ability to make a “baby voice” in a falsetto register (which means she essentially has dual voice modes: a man’s voice and a woman/child’s voice).

Finally, a woman’s body composition might become more muscular but can still retain some curviness with targeted exercises which build up the thighs and such. She will likely be more muscular and less waify than before. Also, her bones will be less susceptible to osteoporosis.
