Today I bought a rectangular blue tarp (made out of some relatively durable yet foldable plastic material and flattened into a sheet which is approximately one milimeter thick) whose dimensions are 13 feet in length and 11 feet in width for approximately $20 and tested it out as my "lazy person's tent" (which seems to provide me adequate shelter from rain and also gives me a sorely "needed" degree of privacy (such that I can block out distractions from my environment and make my body hidden from other humans' unaided eyes (because the feeling of constantly being watched by someone in my environment makes it difficult for me to relax and not feel compelled to put on a performance for whoever might be watching me)) without me having to prop up some flimsy structure with poles nor deal with fragile zippers and mesh fabric). I am quite happy in my new "mobile home" and will keep it folded up in my backpack so that it is available for me to immediately use when I think I'm in a decent spot to camp and crave some rudimentary shelter (and privacy).
