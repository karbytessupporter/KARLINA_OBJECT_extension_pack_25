I sat in a Starbucks store today for approximately three hours in order to update the “micro directory” web page named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com and the web page named COUNT_DOWN_TIMER of the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com. Specifically, I fixed some broken hyperlinks to GitHub-hosted files on the aforementioned “micro directory” web page, uploaded additional media files to that “micro directory”‘s respective GitHub repository, and modified the aforementioned software engineering tutorial web page by providing a hyperlink to an MP4 video file version of the WAV sound file which the JavaScript-powered software application featured in that tutorial web page uses (to indicate when the count-down timer has reached the end of the selected time interval after the “start()” button is clicked). I sat in the Starbucks cafe rather than somewhere more private (such as my room at my legal residence or some remote camping spot away from other people) in order to “simulate” the experience of being a “hybrid worker” (i.e. hybrid between working “remotely” and working “on site”) because doing so helps prevent me from feeling too socially isolated from other people who use their computers while also enabling me to work remotely at my leisure (i.e. when I have “free time” to do so and, for whatever reason, find it more convenient for a particular computer-use session to use my computer somewhere relatively remote (i.e. in my room at my legal residence or some remote camping spot)). I tend to “randomly” sit at the different “third place” public Wi-Fi locations in order to make it harder for people to stalk me (which might not actually be possible due to the fact that I seem to be gang stalked quite heavily by people with more socioeconomic resources than what I have access to) and, also (and most importantly to me), so that I do not take up what I think is “too much space” in one of such locations (i.e. to the extent that I think I am probably an “eye sore” for some people who also use such locations).
