As I was walking home from a second day in a row of sitting in a public Wi-Fi cafe to work on karbytes WayBack Machine backups (and general computer use), I had the thought that the “worst case scenario” version of my existence could already be in effect (i.e., that I am already living it). What such a “worst case scenario” entails is as follows: (a) there is no continuity of my conscious existence (nor that of any other sentient information processing machine) after it ends in death, (b) there is no means to truly immortalize any informational nor physical pattern due to the fact that the universe I live in (and every other universe which ever exists throughout nature) has a finite duration and, like the death of a sentient information processing agent, inevitably “collapses” back into pure formless energy (possibly to eventually explode back out into a new informational and physical universe configuration (but without any “memory” from any previous incarnations of that universe)), and (c) there is no guaranteed way to eventually (and forever after) prevent what I (and possibly many other sentient information processing agents) deem to be horrific, unbearable, and unnecessary suffering. If I somehow became convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that such a “worst case scenario” is indeed the actual state of the reality I inhabit, I would then continue to do what I have been doing (i.e., expanding the collection of public domain and public World Wide Web based digital files referred to by me as karbytes, curating that collection, and backing it up to the WayBack Machine at Archive dot Org and onto M_DISCs which I keep stowed away inside of allegedly fireproof and waterproof containers in my room) because I think that is the closest I can get to (joyfully and authentically) attaining immortality and to immortalizing objects which I cherish (and I claim that all objects are fundamentally composed of digital information (or at least can be partially and essentially preserved as such) within the confines of some encompassing universe). Maybe I or others will find a way to keep our cherished objects instantiated for an indefinitely and perhaps infinitely long time by projecting them from one universe to another (whether any of such destination universe is a virtual reality universe or a parallel and relatively physical reality layer (and I posit that it may be possible to create a new physical universe “out of nowhere” by instantiating a sufficiently complex and self-sustaining virtual reality layer within the hypothetical multiverse (which might take the form of a static “block” or an indefinitely expanding “bubble”)) which is nature as a complete and all-encompassing whole). At the very least, pondering such metaphysical concepts alone and with fellow nerds gives me immense and incomparable satisfaction (and is quite frankly what I most seem to “live for”). Also, what I “live for” (and “live for most”) is engineering or helping to engineer useful technology (especially computation-related technology). In a nutshell, my “purpose in life” amounts to computational technology, natural science, and metaphysics.
