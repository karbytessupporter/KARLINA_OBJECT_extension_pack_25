Although I have already technically confirmed that the aforementioned .onion web page is accessible from devices which are not directly communicating with my Linux laptop which is hosting that .onion web page (using Apache server software and some Wi-Fi Internet connection) by using my Android phone to access that .onion web page via the Android Tor browser application and using that phone's AT&T mobile Internet service (which is paid for per amount of data used rather than some fixed fee per fixed period irregardless of data usage not exceeding some quota) while that laptop is connected to the Tor router network via some Wi-Fi network at a cafe or house, tonight was the first time I ever stepped out of the Wi-Fi network range which that laptop is connected to while serving that .onion web page in order to determine whether I could access that .onion web page from that "remote" location. I did that by first turning on my laptop while it was stationed at my closet desk in my room at my current legal residence in Castro Valley, California and then walking out of my house and to the other side of the hill my residence is on the east side of (in order to ensure that my "remote" testing location was sufficiently "out of range" of the Wi-Fi network connecting my laptop to the router stationed next to the fireplace in the living room of my house). I was able to access the .onion web page from that location (and that connection took approximately thirty seconds to establish).
