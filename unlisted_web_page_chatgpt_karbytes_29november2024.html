<p>The webpage titled &#8220;mdisc_karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_18&#8221; on KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG outlines the contents of an M-DISC labeled &#8220;karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_18,&#8221; which includes the complete public domain web-based intellectual property of karbytes as of 11:59 PM Pacific Standard Time on November 29, 2024. The total data size is approximately 15.0 gigabytes, calculated by summing the sizes of multiple folders. The author notes that while M-DISCs have varying storage capacities—ranging from 4.7 GB to 100 GB—the goal is to store the entire collection on a single disc whenever possible. In cases where duplicate zip files exist, only the most recent versions are included to optimize storage. The author plans to create at least three M-DISC copies of this collection, as well as other specified editions, to ensure preservation.</p>
