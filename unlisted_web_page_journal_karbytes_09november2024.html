<p>Today I bought a rectangular blue <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpaulin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tarp</a> (made out of some relatively durable yet fold-able plastic material and flattened into a sheet which is approximately one millimeter thick) whose dimensions are 13 feet in length and 11 feet in width for approximately $20 and tested it out as my &#8220;lazy person&#8217;s tent&#8221; (which seems to provide me adequate shelter from rain and also gives me a sorely &#8220;needed&#8221; degree of privacy (such that I can block out distractions from my environment and make my body hidden from other humans&#8217; unaided eyes (because the feeling of constantly being watched by someone in my environment makes it difficult for me to relax and not feel compelled to put on a performance for whoever might be watching me)) without me having to prop up some flimsy structure with poles nor deal with fragile zippers and mesh fabric). I am quite happy in my new &#8220;mobile home&#8221; and will keep it folded up in my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backpack</a> so that it is available for me to immediately use when I think I&#8217;m in a decent spot to camp and crave some rudimentary shelter (and privacy).</p>
