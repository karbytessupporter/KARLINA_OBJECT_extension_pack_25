<p>Last night I camped near the railroad tracks in Fremont, Califorina south of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_22/main/baylands_fremont_california_17july2024.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cushing Boulevard</a> and north of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_22/main/baylands_milpitas_california_18july2024.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newby Island</a>. In the morning I had some more personally significant dreams featuring AJP. This time I was somehow in the habit of going over to his apartment (where only he lives) from approximately 1PM to approximately 6PM (even though I was not &#8220;supposed to&#8221; partially because AJP had not invited me to do so but he usually allowed me to come over to his apartment to spend the night with him after approximately 6PM or 7PM after he gets home from work as a paid corporate government-level (if not &#8220;deep state&#8221; level) software engineer). I came over to use his Wi-Fi and got coffee from the nearby Philz to bring back there and used that Wi-Fi to do more of what I typically do and plan to do with my laptop: work on my blog by adding new content to it, curating that content (i.e. correcting any &#8220;errors&#8221; I find in karbytes&#8217; source code (and the blog is essentially all of the digital files which comprise each web page of the websites named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com&#8221;</a> and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com&#8221;</a> and which are each hosted on a karbytes-created and karbytes-owned GitHub repository)). Then, one afternoon, I was &#8220;talking telepathically&#8221; and at times &#8220;out loud&#8221; (me talking &#8220;to myselves&#8221;) while at AJP&#8217;s house and the &#8220;disembodied voice&#8221; I was talking to melded with AJP (in the dream, of course; not necessarily in &#8220;real life&#8221; (i.e. the level of my conscious experience which seems to be more likely to be the physical layer of the computation running my dreams and waking consciousness instead of the layer of that computation which is relatively abstract (i.e. hosted on the aforementioned physical layer)). AJP showed up in the dream and I was outside climbing on top of something while looking at what looked like a display of gasoline prices at a gas station while conversing with &#8220;The Voice&#8221; about my plans for the next two to five years and told it that I was currently <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_employment_adventure_november_2024_part_0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working</a> at Amazon warehouse in <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_22/main/baylands_milpitas_california_25july2024.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milpitas</a> (which is basically true (or what I assume to be true (and will presumably start working a regular &#8220;full time&#8221; shift (at night from 10PM to 2AM)) in &#8220;real life&#8221;) and plan to get a corporate job there as a software engineer within five years while using my warehouse earnings to subsidize the cost of my education, recreation, and basic (survival level and employment related) expenses. When I woke up from that dream and resumed being awake in my &#8220;real life&#8221;, two guys approximately my age were hiking past me (and were very polite to me) and said that they were going past me to the ghost town (and I had never to my knowledge at that time in my life been aware of any such &#8220;ghost town&#8221;). I wondered if they were inter-dimensional beings because there literally seemed to be no trails nor buildings on the other side of the tracks and trail I was on which seemed to be a &#8220;dead end&#8221; partition of that trail. They simply disappeared. At least two Amtrak trains blazed past me while I continued to lay at my camping spot. I was simply basking in my experience and enjoying my thoughts. Then, as I was getting my things packed up and sitting up (with a very sore lower back from incorrect weight distribution of my backpack as a result of not tightening the hip straps enough due to me expanding in girth by wearing multiple layers of sweatpants and shirts due to the bitter cold night climate) and the guys past me once again on their way back towards Cushing Boulevard where they seemed to, like me, had emerged from to arrive at that point near the tracks. After they walked out of my visual range and I thought about going over to check out what is on the other side of the tracks, I decided to give it a go and walked across the tracks (while being a little nervous that a <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_22/main/fremont_california_18august2024.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">train</a> would suddenly start barreling towards me). I exited the tracks onto the west side (I was camping on the east side of those tracks) to discover indeed a literal <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_town" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;ghost town&#8221;</a>. Later on that day (while munching on vegan food items which I bought from Whole Foods in Dublin, California (after bicycling and riding the BART train from Warm Springs BART station to the &#8220;end of the line&#8221; east Dublin BART station)) inside of a large grassy area which looked reminiscent of where I had been camping earlier that day (which looks like biome material I would colloquially classify as &#8220;the boonies&#8221;), I decided to search the World Wide Web for information about the &#8220;ghost town&#8221; I had been inspired to visit earlier today. I discovered that it was called <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawbridge,_California" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drawbridge, California</a> and an interesting &#8220;1990s&#8221; website which referenced that place and other places in South East Bay region (of the San Francisco Bay Area in California of the United States of America) at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.sanjose.com/underbelly/unbelly/Draw/draw1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.sanjose.com/underbelly/unbelly/Draw/draw1.html</a>.
