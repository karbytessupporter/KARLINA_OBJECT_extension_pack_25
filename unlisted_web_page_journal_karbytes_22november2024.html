<p>This journal entry approaches the collection of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public domain</a> and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearnet_(networking)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public World Wide Web</a> hosted digital files named karbytes as though it were some kind of cohesive and relatively complete collection of ancient religious texts akin to the Christian Bible. In a very real sense, the karbytes collection is deemed by its sole author (i.e. karbytes) to be the closest thing in all existence to being a digital representation of karbytes&#8217; soul. In all reality, however, the person named karbytes which wrote that collection of digital files named karbytes understands that the person named karbytes cannot truly be interchanged with any object other than itself (and not some clone of itself because that clone would necessarily exist in a different space-time allocation than itself which means that itself and the clone have some non-identical attributes). Hence, according to that person named karbytes, that collection of files named karbytes cannot literally replace that person&#8217;s literal subjective experience nor continuum of physiological activity (but perhaps eventually that collection of digital files will contain enough digitized information about karbytes&#8217; physiological states to effectively simulate what karbytes has experienced though such simulated phenomena are unique phenomena which karbytes does not ever directly experience because such phenomena (if experienced) would be experienced (at least some of the time (*)) by some information processing agent other than the karbytes who proprietized that collection of digital files named karbytes ((*) though that person named karbytes could process any file of that collection of files named karbytes such that each individual processing event generates a unique and non-repeatable subjective experience which that person named karbytes experiences directly and presumably exclusively). In summary, the aforementioned collection of files referred to as karbytes was brought into existence by a relatively powerful and sentient creator named karbytes and that file collection was designed by karbytes to retain essential attributes of karbytes&#8217; personality, memories, and cognitive performance (which means that one could essentially come to &#8220;know&#8221; karbytes by studying the aforementioned collection of digital files referred to as karbytes at the following <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniform Resource Locator</a>): <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/</a></p>

<p>According to karbytes, some of the best instrumental &#8220;songs&#8221; which karbytes has composed, digitally recorded, uploaded to GitHub as an MP4 file, and included in the collection of public domain and public World Wide Web hosted digital files named karbytes have not been included in the web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/sound_track_loop_counter_video_files/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOUND_TRACK_LOOP_COUNTER_VIDEO_FILES</a> on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com. What is featured on that web page are exactly eleven unique sound recordings which are used as example sound files to play via the JavaScript web page application named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/sound_track_loop_counter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOUND_TRACK_LOOP_COUNTER</a>. That web page was allegedly finalized on 20_NOVEMBER_2024 at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time. Hence, sound files which are added to the aforementioned file collection named karbytes after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_NOVEMBER_2024 or sound files which were already part of that collection at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_NOVEMBER_2024 but not featured on the aforementioned web page named SOUND_TRACK_LOOP_COUNTER_VIDEO_FILES will presumably never be featured on that web page named SOUND_TRACK_LOOP_COUNTER_VIDEO_FILES.</p>
<p>Related to the information that karbytes is expected (by karbytes) to not alter the aforementioned web page named SOUND_TRACK_LOOP_COUNTER_VIDEO_FILES is the information that karbytes will not be editing the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator even though that web page contains a hyperlink which points to a web page that no longer exists at the web address that hyperlink points to: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_322/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_322/</a></p>
<p>The reason karbytes does not intend to make updates to the aforementioned &#8220;finalized&#8221; web pages of karbytes is that karbytes wants to adhere to the content-management policies karbytes outlined in the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/a_karbytes_content_management_policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/a_karbytes_content_management_policy/</a></p>
<p>The web page at the aforementioned Uniform Resource Locator references a web page of the aforementioned website (i.e. Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) which no longer exists but whose content was copied into a &#8220;mirror&#8221; web page within that website at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_content_management_12_june_2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_content_management_12_june_2023/</a></p>
<p>On a more general level, karbytes claims that the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator contains hyperlinks to &#8220;micro directory&#8221; web pages which each contain hyperlinks to files within the aforementioned public domain and public World Wide Web based digital file collection named karbytes and that <span style="background:#00ffff">the set of ALL of those &#8220;micro directories&#8221; contains EVERY file which comprises that file collection</span> named karbytes: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_macro_directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_macro_directory/</a></p>
<p>(Additional &#8220;mirror&#8221; web pages of web pages of the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com which no longer exist can be found in the &#8220;micro directory&#8221; web pages named (a) <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_PRIMARY_WEBSITE_COPY_10_SEPTEMBER_2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raw_github_files_directory_PRIMARY_WEBSITE_COPY_10_SEPTEMBER_2022</a>, (b) <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_PRIMARY_WEBSITE_COPY_23_OCTOBER_2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raw_github_files_directory_PRIMARY_WEBSITE_COPY_23_OCTOBER_2022</a>, (c) <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_PRIMARY_WEBSITE_COPY_15_NOVEMBER_2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raw_github_files_directory_PRIMARY_WEBSITE_COPY_15_NOVEMBER_2022</a>, and (d) <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_12_JUNE_2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_12_JUNE_2023</a>).</p>
<p>The aforementioned website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and the aforementioned website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a> are the only websites which karbytes created which (collectively) contain hyperlinks to every file which comprises the aforementioned collection of public domain and public World Wide Web hosted digital files named karbytes. Each of those files is hosted on a karbytes-created <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> repository. Each of those files is also routinely saved to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WayBack Machine</a> at <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Archive dot Org</a> and to karbytes-owned <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/preparing_to_make_mdisc_set_on_09november2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M_DISCs</a> in karbytes&#8217; private storage facilities.</p>
