<p>This note is a continuation of yesterday&#8217;s note (whose Uniform Resource Locator is as follows):</p>
<p><a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/journal_karbytes_27november2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/journal_karbytes_27november2024/</a></p>

<p>Within the past three weeks I stopped using my bicycle every day and I started spending most of my time in the East Bay region (instead of spending approximately six days per week &#8220;camping&#8221; in Silicon Valley (in the South Bay) region). I predominantly use my bicycle for trips to and through the South Bay because those areas are many times vaster in area than the regions I think of as my home land.</p>
<p>(For more information on what I consider to be my home land territory (though I consider that territory to, by default and predominantly, be ownerless space), visit the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator):</p>
<p><a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/map_of_karbytes_home_environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/map_of_karbytes_home_environment/</a></p>
<p>I have started becoming more physically sore and cautious after having experienced several accidents while bicycling this year (and each of those incidents took place in Sunnyvale near Google Cloud campus). The only &#8220;damages&#8221; were the driver&#8217;s windshield getting cracked and my bicycle getting destroyed beyond repair. None of us were apparently physically injured in any significant way.</p>
<p>The first and most serious incident involved me getting hit by a car while bicycling across a freeway entrance at approximately 11:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 22_AUGUST_2024. Details about that incident are available on the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator:</p>
<p><a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_22_august_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_22_august_2024/</a></p>
<p>The second and least serious incident involved me trying to brake abruptly in order to avoid colliding with a car going through the cross walk (and I was braking while going down a small hill). I ended up falling off my bicycle and using my left arm to brace my fall and thought that I had broken a bone in my upper arm or shoulder. I could hardly move my arm which was throbbing in pain for weeks afterwards but I was grateful to still be able to operate my bicycle and lift and wear my heavy backpack (despite my shoulder&#8217;s range of motion being a bit limited for several weeks after the incident). I did not bother documenting that incident because it did not seem to be sufficiently relevant to what I thought was the topic range I was &#8220;supposed to&#8221; be covering for the sake of &#8220;completing a unit&#8221; on &#8220;real-world anthropology&#8221; in conjunction with my learning to be an adept &#8220;digital nomad&#8221; and &#8220;environmentally conscious&#8221; consumer (and commuter).</p>
<p>Every day I have a plethora of &#8220;gory&#8221; thoughts which I simply tolerate and find some degree of amusement in. I do not usually bother writing those thoughts down in explicit detail because I do not want to get into the habit (or set the precedent) that my personal websites (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>) are pornography hubs for &#8220;gore porn&#8221; and other &#8220;low quality&#8221; filibuster content which dilutes the concentration of karbytes to filibuster ratio (and I want the intellectual property referred to as <strong>karbytes</strong> (according to the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator) to be as high of a concentration of karbytes as possible (which is &#8220;not to a fault&#8221; (because &#8220;impurities&#8221; help to introduce new qualities which would take longer to emerge via &#8220;natural selection&#8221; on their own (i.e. via karbytes exclusively (i.e. content which is originally generated by karbytes rather than copied (whole or in part) from some other source))))):</p>

<p>To avoid getting into gory situations personally, I have started (within the past three weeks) taking better care of my physical well-being and being more cautious in my behavior. Rather than leave my bicycle parked and locked in some public location over night, I have started keeping my bicycle stowed away in my room at my legal residence as depicted by the following video &#8220;tour&#8221; of that room:</p>
